"""Durable bookkeeping for outbound email.

Two tables, both read and written on the send path in ``apps.common.mail``:

``EmailSendCounter``
    The budget. One row per (scope, key, period) — the global daily total, and
    per-recipient hourly/daily totals.

``EmailSuppression``
    Addresses we have been told to stop mailing (hard bounce, spam complaint).

The state lives in the database rather than the cache for the same reason
``apps.common.quota`` gives: ``REDIS_URL`` is optional
(``config/settings/base.py``), so the fallback cache is a per-process
LocMemCache that every deploy and every dyno restart empties — precisely the
moments a budget most needs to hold. A cache-backed cap is also per-process, so
it silently multiplies by the worker count the first time the app scales out.
