"""Subscribing and unsubscribing accounts to their platform's activity push.

Webhooks are the fast path for comments and mentions, not the only one:
``run_inbox_sync_cycle`` polls every connected account every few minutes. A
failed subscription therefore degrades the inbox to polling latency rather than
breaking it — which is what the account card says, and why a failure is
recorded on the account instead of on ``last_error`` (owned by the periodic
health check, which would wipe it on the next successful token check).

Lives outside ``views`` because four callers need it: the OAuth flow, the
card's retry button, the periodic health check, and the ``subscribe_webhooks``
backfill command.
