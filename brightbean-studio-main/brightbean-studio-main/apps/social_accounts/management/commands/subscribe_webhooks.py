"""Subscribe already-connected accounts to their platform webhooks.

Subscription happens when an account is connected, so every account connected
before that code existed is still unsubscribed — its comments reach the inbox
only on the polling cycle, minutes late, instead of instantly. Run this once
after deploying, and again whenever you want to repair accounts whose
subscription was refused.

Mostly a bulk tool now: the periodic health check retries failed subscriptions
on its own, and the account card offers a one-click retry.
