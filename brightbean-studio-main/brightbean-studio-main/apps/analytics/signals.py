    Without this, enabling a platform changes nothing visible until the hourly
    ``sync_all_account_analytics`` cron happens to run: accounts whose token
    predates the toggle fail on scope there, and only then get flagged for
    reconnect. Running the backfill now collapses that window — the account
    either gets its first snapshot or gets flagged for reconnect.

    Deliberately narrow about what counts as "switched on":

    * ``created`` is skipped. A platform with no row already reads as enabled
      (see ``AnalyticsPlatformConfig.enabled_platforms``), so writing a first
      row with ``is_enabled=True`` states the status quo rather than changing it.
    * Platforms with no analytics API at all (``NO_ANALYTICS_PLATFORMS``) are
      skipped via the shared ``analytics_availability`` predicate — the same
      gate the page, the cron and the agent API use. Queueing them would insert
      a task per account that returns immediately, the waste
      ``sync_all_account_analytics`` documents having already stamped out.

    Note ``queryset.update()`` fires no signals at all, so a bulk update still
    bypasses this — the analytics page's copy therefore does not promise the
    re-check, it only offers reconnecting as a possibility.
