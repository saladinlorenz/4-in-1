    ``PostInsightsSnapshot.value`` stores the cumulative-lifetime count for
    that metric at sync time. To get "what happened on day D" we take
    ``snapshot(D) - snapshot(latest before D)`` per post and sum across the
    account's posts. Used as a hero/chart fallback when no
    ``AccountInsightsSnapshot`` rows exist for the metric — keeps the main
    page consistent with the per-post drawer for platforms that ship without
    an account-level analytics API.

    Returns ``(daily_totals, max_captured_at, observed_days)``. The caller
    folds ``max_captured_at`` into the bundle's freshness signal so a
    fallback-only YouTube/TikTok response doesn't report "no data yet".
    ``observed_days`` are the days we actually measured, including days
    whose delta was zero (which ``daily_totals`` leaves out): a quiet day is
    a real 0, while a day with no snapshot yet is missing, and the averages
    and sparklines treat the two differently.

    Three correctness rules in the iteration:
      * The query is bounded to ``[start, end]`` for performance. The first
        observation per post (typical for accounts that just connected:
        backfill writes a single cumulative-lifetime row dated today) needs
        special handling — naively crediting ``value - 0`` dumps the entire
        lifetime onto the snapshot day. Three cases:
          - Post published BEFORE the window: anchor ``prev_value`` and
            skip the credit. The cumulative is mostly pre-window activity
            we can't attribute to days we don't have snapshots for.
          - Post published INSIDE the window: distribute the cumulative
            uniformly across ``[pub_day, snapshot_day]`` so the lifetime
            isn't piled onto the snapshot day. This matches what Codex's
            adversarial review flagged — for an account where backfill
            writes a single lifetime snapshot per post, the chart would
            otherwise inflate today by the sum of every in-window post's
            lifetime totals.
          - Missing/post-snapshot ``published_at``: fall back to crediting
            the snapshot day. Conservative, matches legacy behavior.
      * A negative delta (count reset, deleted reactions, platform recount)
        skips both the credit AND the ``prev_value`` advance, so a later
        recovery is measured against the pre-reset high-water mark instead
        of being over-credited.

    Three columns, never model instances. ``PostInsightsSnapshot`` is one row
    per (post, metric, day) and carries two JSONFields — ``raw`` is the entire
    provider response — and Django decodes both eagerly while hydrating a row.
    Pulling these as models therefore ran a ``json.loads`` over every payload
    in the table for the account, twice per row, to read three numbers none of
    which are in the JSON. On an account with 300 posts and 90 days of history

    ~60 MB of headroom.

    Postgres rather than in Python, so the query returns one row per
    (post, metric) instead of one per day. The ``order_by`` prefix it requires
    is the ordering this needs anyway.

    That is an optimization, not a requirement: README documents SQLite for
    local development and small deployments, and SQLite inherits Django's base
    ``distinct_sql``, which raises ``NotSupportedError`` the moment any field is
    passed. So the clause is applied only when the backend advertises it, and
