    The grain is the *credential*, not the account. YouTube charges Data API
    quota to the Google Cloud project behind the OAuth client, so one exhausted
    project must stop every account that shares it — a per-account breaker would
    let the second account keep burning a budget the first one already emptied.
    Per-platform would be too coarse in the other direction: an org that brings
    its own credentials has its own project and must not be blocked by someone
    else's exhaustion. ``credential_key`` is a hash of the resolved client_id,
    never the client_id itself, so the same project maps to the same row without
    storing a secret.

    ``quota_scope`` separates budgets the same platform meters independently —
    YouTube's Data API and Analytics API have separate quotas, and blocking the
    cheap batched Analytics call because the Data API ran dry would throw away
    the part of the sync that was never the problem. ``videos.insert`` has a
    third, "upload", since YouTube gave it its own bucket. Empty for platforms
    with a single pool.

    Deliberately not ``apps.publisher.models.RateLimitState``: that table is
    read by the publish engine as a hard gate on *publishing*, so writing a
    read-side analytics block into it would silently stop the account posting.
