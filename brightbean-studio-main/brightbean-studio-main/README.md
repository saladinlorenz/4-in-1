## About BrightBean Studio

BrightBean Studio is an open-source, self-hostable social media management platform built for creators, agencies and SMBs. It does what Sendible, SocialPilot, or ContentStudio do, but free and without per-seat, per-channel, or per-workspace limits. Plan, compose, schedule, approve, publish, and monitor content across Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest, Threads, Bluesky, Google Business Profile, Mastodon, and DEV.to from a single multi-workspace dashboard.

It's for people managing many client accounts under one roof who'd rather own their social stack than pay $100–300/month to a SaaS vendor. Every feature is available to every user. No paid tier, no feature gate, no upsell.

A free hosted version is available at [brightbean.xyz/studio](https://brightbean.xyz/studio/). You can also deploy it yourself with a one-click button on Heroku, Render, or Railway, run it on your own VPS via Docker, or run it locally. All platform integrations talk directly to the official first-party APIs using your own developer credentials, so there's no aggregator middleman, no vendor lock-in, and no third party sitting between you and your data.

## Features

### Hosted Version

A free hosted version of Brightbean Studio is available at [brightbean.xyz/studio](https://brightbean.xyz/studio/). It runs the same codebase as this repository, with no setup or maintenance required.

If you'd rather self-host, choose one of the options below.

### One-Click Deploy

| Heroku | Render | Railway |
|:------:|:------:|:-------:|
| [![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/brightbeanxyz/brightbean-studio) | [![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/brightbeanxyz/brightbean-studio) | [![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/brightbean-studio?referralCode=brightbean) |

After deploying, set these environment variables in your platform's dashboard:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` | Auto-set | `config.settings.production`. Set if deployment config has not placed it. |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Auto-generated | Django secret key. Set automatically by the deploy button. |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY_SALT` | Auto-generated | Encryption salt. Set automatically by the deploy button. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Auto-provisioned | PostgreSQL connection string. Set automatically. |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Yes | Your app's domain, e.g. `your-app.herokuapp.com` |
| `APP_URL` | Yes | Full public URL, e.g. `https://your-app.herokuapp.com` |
| `STORAGE_BACKEND` | No | Set to `s3` for S3/R2 storage. Default: `local`. Heroku, Render, and Railway have ephemeral filesystems, so uploaded files are lost on redeploy without S3. |
| `SERVE_MEDIA` | No | Only used with `STORAGE_BACKEND=local`. Default: `true`, so Django serves uploads at `/media/`. Those files are served **unauthenticated** — anyone with the path can fetch them. That is required in this mode: Instagram, Threads, Facebook, Pinterest, Google Business and dev.to fetch attachment URLs server-side when publishing, so `/media/` must be publicly reachable. Only the media library, avatars and workspace icons are exposed this way (`PUBLIC_MEDIA_PREFIXES` in `config/urls.py`); comment attachments go through a permission-checked view. Set to `false` only when a reverse proxy or CDN serves those prefixes on the same public path instead. |
| `CADDY_MEDIA_ROOT` | No | docker-compose only. Where Caddy reads uploads from. Default: `/app/media`. Set to `/var/empty` when `STORAGE_BACKEND=s3` — the `media_data` volume survives the switch and Caddy cannot see `SERVE_MEDIA`, so it would otherwise keep serving whatever uploads were left behind. |
| `S3_ENDPOINT_URL` | If using S3 | S3-compatible endpoint URL |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | If using S3 | S3 access key |
| `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | If using S3 | S3 secret key |
| `S3_BUCKET_NAME` | If using S3 | S3 bucket name |
| `EMAIL_HOST` | No | SMTP server for sending invitations and password resets |
| `EMAIL_PORT` | No | SMTP port (default: `587`) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | No | SMTP username |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` | No | SMTP password |
| `GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` | No | For Google OAuth login. Get from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) → Credentials. |
| `GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | No | Google OAuth secret |
| `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` | No | Enables Unsplash stock-photo search in the composer. Create a free app at [unsplash.com/developers](https://unsplash.com/developers). |

For social media API keys, see [Platform Credentials](#platform-credentials). Full variable reference: `.env.example`.

## Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brightbeanxyz/brightbean-studio.git
cd brightbean-studio
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` - change `DATABASE_URL` to point to the Docker service name:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/brightbean
```

Then start everything:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose exec app python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Database migrations run automatically via the `migrate` Compose service before
the `app` and `worker` services start, so there is no separate migrate step.

Tailwind compiles automatically via the `tailwind` Compose service. First build
takes ~60–90 seconds (running `npm install` in a fresh container); subsequent
starts are instant. Watch progress with `docker compose logs -f tailwind`.

Open http://localhost:8000 - you're running.


## Fully Local Development (without Docker)

Run everything natively - no Docker, no PostgreSQL install. Uses SQLite for the database.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 20+

### Setup

**1. Clone and configure**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brightbeanxyz/brightbean-studio.git
cd brightbean-studio
cp .env.example .env
```

**2. Switch to SQLite**

Open `.env` and replace the `DATABASE_URL` line:

```
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
```

That's it - no database server to install or manage.

**3. Set up Python**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Set up Tailwind CSS**

```bash
cd theme/static_src
npm install
cd ../..
```

**5. Run database migrations**

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

**6. Create your admin account**

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

**7. Start the app (3 terminal tabs)**

Tab 1 - Tailwind watcher:
```bash
cd theme/static_src && npm run start
```

Tab 2 - Django dev server:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver
```

Tab 3 - Background worker:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python manage.py process_tasks
```

Open http://localhost:8000 and log in with the superuser you created.

### Daily workflow (Docker-free)

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate                # activate Python env
python manage.py runserver               # start web server
# (open another tab)
python manage.py process_tasks           # start worker
```

> **Note:** SQLite is fine for local development and small deployments. For production or heavy concurrent usage, switch to PostgreSQL.

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

With coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=apps --cov-report=term-missing
```

## Linting & Type Checking

```bash
ruff check .                             # lint
ruff format --check .                    # format check
mypy apps/ config/ --ignore-missing-imports  # type check
```

Auto-fix lint issues:

```bash
ruff check --fix .
ruff format .
```

## Production Deployment

### Docker Compose on a VPS (recommended)

```bash
# On your server:
git clone https://github.com/brightbeanxyz/brightbean-studio.git
cd brightbean-studio
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env:
#   SECRET_KEY=<generate a random 50+ char string>
#   DEBUG=false
#   ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com
#   APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
#   DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:<strong-password>@postgres:5432/brightbean

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
docker compose exec app python manage.py createsuperuser
```

This starts 5 containers: app (Gunicorn), worker, PostgreSQL, Caddy (auto-HTTPS), and a one-shot migrate container that runs database migrations automatically on startup. Edit the `Caddyfile` with your domain.

With the default `STORAGE_BACKEND=local`, Caddy serves uploaded media directly from the `media_data` volume at `/media/`, so large images and video never occupy a Gunicorn worker thread and byte-range requests (video seeking) work. Django's own `/media/` route stays available as the fallback for deployments without this proxy.

To update:

```bash
git pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

### Other Platforms

| Platform | Config file | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Heroku** | `Procfile` + `app.json` | Deploy-button ready. Must use Basic+ dynos (Eco dynos break the worker). |
| **Railway** | `railway.toml` | The [one-click template](https://railway.com/deploy/brightbean-studio) provisions three services: web (Gunicorn, runs `migrate` on startup), worker (`python manage.py process_tasks`), and managed PostgreSQL. The web service's startup `migrate` fires the `post_migrate` hooks that register the recurring tasks, so scheduling works out of the box. |
| **Render** | `render.yaml` | Blueprint with web, worker, PostgreSQL. Must use paid tier. |

All platforms with ephemeral filesystems require `STORAGE_BACKEND=s3` - see `.env.example` for S3 configuration.

**Memory sizing.** Importing the app costs roughly 100 MB before it serves a request, and a warmed Gunicorn worker settles near 200 MB - so the shipped command runs a single threaded worker (`--workers 1 --threads 4`), which fits a 512 MB dyno with room for media handling. Raise `--workers` only when you raise the memory to match; a rule of thumb is 250 MB per worker. Do **not** add `--max-requests`: gthread stops heartbeating at the start of the request that trips the counter, so the arbiter kills the worker mid-request once `--timeout` (30s) passes - which drops whichever upload happened to be that request, and uploads here can be up to 1 GB. The `worker` process needs the same headroom: it downloads videos to disk and streams them to the platform, and if it is killed mid-publish (Heroku's R15, an OOM kill, a deploy) the affected post is failed by the confirmation sweep rather than left in limbo.

**Why the worker runs with `--duration 3600`.** `process_tasks` is a single non-forking process that runs every task in the same heap and never restarts, so a peak allocation raises RSS permanently - CPython and glibc keep the freed pages in their own arenas. Left alone it ratchets: on a 512 MB Basic dyno it climbed from ~280 MB after a deploy to 566 MB over 15 hours and sat at 110% of quota. `--duration` is checked at the *top* of the run loop, so a task in flight always finishes; the process then exits 0 between tasks and the platform restarts it at its floor. Nothing is lost - a recycle cannot interrupt a publish, and `confirm_pending_publishes` settles anything in flight regardless. Don't go below ~1800s, where Heroku's crash cool-off starts to engage. Other deploy targets keep the plain command: `docker-compose.yml` has no `restart:` policy on the worker, so there a clean exit would simply stop it.

**`MALLOC_ARENA_MAX`.** glibc gives each thread its own arena (up to 64 MB) capped at `8 x nproc`, and containers report the host's core count, so the cap is effectively unbounded. This app has real thread churn - the publisher builds a fresh pool every 15s and boto3's managed transfer adds ten threads per download - and those arenas are never returned to the OS. On Heroku this is already set to 2 by the repo's `.profile`, which applies to web, worker, the release phase and one-off `heroku run` dynos alike; it is written as a default rather than an override, so a config var still wins if you want to tune it. Deploy targets that build from the `Dockerfile` (Render, Railway, docker-compose) do not read `.profile` - set it in their own environment config if the host is memory-tight.

See `architecture.md` for detailed per-platform instructions and cost breakdowns.

> **Settings selection:** The `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable controls which settings file Django uses. The defaults are already wired for each context: `manage.py` uses `development`, `wsgi.py`/`asgi.py` use `production`, and `pytest` uses `test` (via `pyproject.toml`). Docker Compose files and platform deploy configs (Heroku, Render) also set it explicitly. You only need to override it manually if you want a non-default module for a specific command, e.g. `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.production python manage.py check --deploy`.

## Platform Credentials

To connect social media accounts, you need API credentials from each platform's developer portal. You can set these via environment variables in `.env` (see `.env.example`) or, per organization, through the Django admin at `{APP_URL}/admin/` → **Credentials → Platform credentials** (superuser only). If a platform is configured in both places, the `.env` value takes precedence.

**Admin UI access (superuser only):** The Django admin at `{APP_URL}/admin/` (for example `https://brightbean.example.com/admin/`) is restricted to superuser accounts — only a superuser can view or edit platform credentials there. If you don't already have one, create a superuser, then sign in and open **Credentials → Platform credentials**:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
# Docker: docker compose exec app python manage.py createsuperuser
```

**Redirect URI:** When registering your app on any platform, set the OAuth redirect URI to:

```
{APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/{platform}/
```

For example, if your `APP_URL` is `https://brightbean.example.com`, the Facebook redirect URI would be `https://brightbean.example.com/social-accounts/callback/facebook/`.

> **TikTok:** use the slug `social1` instead of `tiktok` — TikTok rejects redirect URIs containing their brand name. See the [TikTok](#tiktok) section.

### Meta (Facebook, Instagram, Threads)

Facebook and Instagram share the same Meta app credentials. Threads runs on the same Meta app but uses a **separate app identity** — its own App ID, App Secret, and redirect URI list (steps 6-7 below).

1. Go to [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) and create a new app (type: **Business**)
2. Under **App Settings → Basic**, copy your **App ID** and **App Secret** — the plain ones, for Facebook and Instagram. Once the Threads use case is added this page also lists a **Threads App ID** / **Threads App Secret**; those are a different app identity and belong in the Threads variables in step 7, not here.
3. In the App Dashboard, go to **Use cases** and add the following four use cases. For each use case, click into it and go to **Permissions and features** to add the required optional permissions:

   **Use case: "Manage everything on your Page"** (Facebook)
   - This use case auto-includes `business_management`, `pages_show_list`, and `public_profile`
   - Add these optional permissions: `pages_manage_posts`, `pages_manage_engagement`, `pages_read_engagement`, `pages_read_user_content`, `pages_manage_metadata`, `read_insights`

   **Use case: "Messenger from Meta"** (Facebook Messaging)
   - Required to enable the `pages_messaging` permission, which is not available under the "Manage Pages" use case
   - Add the optional permission: `pages_messaging`

   **Use case: "Manage messaging & content on Instagram"** (Instagram)
   - Add these permissions: `instagram_basic`, `instagram_content_publish`, `instagram_manage_comments`, `instagram_manage_insights`

   **Use case: "Access the Threads API"** (Threads)
   - This use case auto-includes `threads_basic`
   - Add these optional permissions: `threads_content_publish`, `threads_manage_insights`, `threads_manage_replies`

4. Under **Facebook Login → Settings → Valid OAuth Redirect URIs**, add the following redirect URIs:
   ```
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/facebook/
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/instagram/
   ```
   > **Threads is separate.** Its callback does **not** belong here — the Threads use case keeps its own redirect URI list. See step 7.
5. **Webhooks (required for the inbox).** In the App Dashboard, go to **Webhooks** (also reachable via **Use cases → Manage everything on your Page → Webhooks**) and subscribe to the **Page** object:
   - **Callback URL:** `{APP_URL}/webhooks/facebook/`
   - **Verify token:** the value of `FACEBOOK_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` from your `.env` (any random string; generate one and set the env var before clicking *Verify and save*)
   - After verification, subscribe to the `feed`, `mention`, and `messages` fields. `feed` is what carries comments on your Page's posts.

   > **This step is easy to miss and fails silently.** Connecting a Page subscribes it to your app automatically, so the account shows as healthy either way — but without the callback URL configured here, Meta never delivers anything. Comments then arrive only through the 5-minute polling fallback, and mentions not at all. Run `python manage.py diagnose_facebook --account-id <uuid>` to check.

   **If you connect Instagram through this Facebook app, also subscribe to the `Instagram` object** on the same Webhooks page:
   - **Callback URL:** `{APP_URL}/webhooks/facebook/` (the same endpoint — it handles both platforms)
   - Subscribe to the `comments` and `mentions` fields.

   > `comments` and `mentions` belong to the **Instagram** object, not the Page — a Page accepts only its own fields (`feed`, `mention`, `messages`, …). Studio subscribes the Instagram *account* automatically on connect, but the object-level configuration here can only be done in the dashboard. Without it, Instagram comments arrive only via the 5-minute poll and mentions not at all.
6. Set the environment variables:
   ```
   PLATFORM_FACEBOOK_APP_ID=your-app-id
   PLATFORM_FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=your-app-secret
   # Optional: Facebook Login for Business configuration ID for agency/multi-business onboarding
   PLATFORM_FACEBOOK_CONFIG_ID=your-configuration-id
   FACEBOOK_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN=your-random-verify-token
   ```
   When `PLATFORM_FACEBOOK_CONFIG_ID` is set, Facebook and the Facebook-login
   Instagram connector use that Login for Business configuration instead of
   sending an ad-hoc `scope` list. Configure the required permissions and asset
   selection in Meta's configuration, and include every business whose Pages
   should be available to the login.
7. **Threads:** the "Access the Threads API" use case gets its own App ID, App Secret, and redirect URIs. Go to **Use cases → Access the Threads API → Settings** and add the Threads redirect URI:
   ```
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/threads/
   ```
   Then copy the **Threads App ID** and **Threads App Secret** (also listed under **App settings → Basic**, alongside — and different from — your Facebook App ID) and set:
   ```
   PLATFORM_THREADS_APP_ID=your-threads-app-id
   PLATFORM_THREADS_APP_SECRET=your-threads-app-secret
   ```
   These have no fallback: until both are set, Threads shows as **Not Configured** on the connect page. Sending the Facebook App ID to Threads fails with error `4476002`.

### Instagram (Direct, via Instagram Login)

The Instagram (Direct) connector uses the **Instagram API with Instagram Login** - a separate OAuth flow from the Facebook Login-based Instagram connector above. It works with **Professional** Instagram accounts (Business or Creator) **without** requiring a linked Facebook Page.

> **Account-type requirement:** Personal Instagram accounts have no API access since the Instagram Basic Display API was retired on 2024-12-04. Users must convert their account to Professional first (free, in IG Settings → *Account type and tools* → *Switch to professional account*).

1. In the same Meta app, go to **Use cases** and add the **"Instagram API"** use case
2. Under **API setup with Instagram Login**, note your **Instagram App ID** and **Instagram App Secret** (these are different from your Facebook App ID/Secret)
3. Go to **Permissions and features** and add the required permissions:
   - `instagram_business_basic`, `instagram_business_content_publish`, `instagram_business_manage_comments`, `instagram_business_manage_messages`, `instagram_business_manage_insights`
4. Under **API setup with Instagram Login → Step 4: Set up Instagram business login**, click **Set up** and add the redirect URI (must match exactly, including the trailing slash):
   ```
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/instagram_login/
   ```
5. Under **API setup with Instagram Login → Step 3: Configure webhooks**, set:
   - **Callback URL:** `{APP_URL}/webhooks/instagram_login/`
   - **Verify token:** the value of `INSTAGRAM_LOGIN_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` from your `.env` (any random string; generate one and set the env var before clicking Verify and save). After verification, subscribe to the `messages`, `comments`, and `mentions` fields.
6. Set the environment variables:
   ```
   PLATFORM_INSTAGRAM_APP_ID=your-instagram-app-id
   PLATFORM_INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET=your-instagram-app-secret
   INSTAGRAM_LOGIN_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN=your-random-verify-token
   ```

### LinkedIn

Brightbean Studio supports two LinkedIn paths. Pick whichever your LinkedIn dev app can obtain - or both, on separate apps.

**Path A - Personal-only (any individual developer can do this):**

1. Go to the [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://developer.linkedin.com/) and create a new app (no Company Page verification required).
2. Under **Products**, request access to (both auto-approved):
   - **Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect**
   - **Share on LinkedIn**
3. Under **Auth**, add the redirect URI:
   ```
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/linkedin_personal/
   ```
4. Scopes: `openid`, `profile`, `email`, `w_member_social`.
5. Set the environment variables:
   ```
   PLATFORM_LINKEDIN_PERSONAL_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   PLATFORM_LINKEDIN_PERSONAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   ```

> **Limitations of Path A:** access tokens last ~60 days and LinkedIn does not issue refresh tokens for these scopes - users must manually reconnect every ~60 days. Inbox / comment-reading is not available for personal accounts on this path.

**Path B - Company Pages (also enables full Personal features):**

1. Go to the [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://developer.linkedin.com/) and create a new app.
2. Verify the app's association with a LinkedIn Company Page.
3. Under **Products**, request access to:
   - **Community Management API** *(restricted - requires LinkedIn review)*
4. Under **Auth**, add **both** redirect URIs:
   ```
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/linkedin_personal/
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/linkedin_company/
   ```
5. Scopes:
   - **Personal:** `r_basicprofile`, `w_member_social`, `r_member_social`
   - **Company:** `r_basicprofile`, `w_member_social`, `w_organization_social`, `r_organization_social`, `rw_organization_admin`
6. Set the environment variables:
   ```
   PLATFORM_LINKEDIN_COMPANY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   PLATFORM_LINKEDIN_COMPANY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   ```

If you set only the Path B (Company) credentials, Brightbean Studio automatically reuses them for personal connections too - refresh tokens (365-day) and inbox both work. You only need Path A vars if you have a separate Personal-only app.

> **Note:** "Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect" / "Share on LinkedIn" and "Community Management API" are **mutually exclusive** on a single LinkedIn app. You need separate apps for Path A and Path B.

> **Backwards compatibility:** the legacy `PLATFORM_LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID` / `PLATFORM_LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET` env vars are still honored as a fallback for both `linkedin_personal` and `linkedin_company` - existing self-hosters keep working without changes. The legacy credentials are assumed to be CM-approved; if your legacy app is OIDC-only, migrate it to `PLATFORM_LINKEDIN_PERSONAL_*`.

### TikTok

1. Go to the [TikTok Developer Portal](https://developers.tiktok.com/) and create a new app
2. Add the products **Login Kit** and **Content Posting API**
3. Configure the redirect URI — use `social1`, not `tiktok` (TikTok rejects URIs containing their brand name):
   ```
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/social1/
   ```
4. Required scopes: `user.info.basic`, `video.publish`, `video.upload`, `video.list`
5. Note: TikTok uses **Client Key** (not Client ID). Copy the **Client Key** and **Client Secret** from your app dashboard
6. Set the environment variables:
   ```
   PLATFORM_TIKTOK_CLIENT_KEY=your-client-key
   PLATFORM_TIKTOK_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   ```
7. For production review, record the demo video against a TikTok **Sandbox** showing every requested scope in use.

### Google (YouTube, Google Business Profile)

YouTube and Google Business Profile share the same Google Cloud credentials.

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project (or select an existing one)
2. Enable the following APIs under **APIs & Services → Library**:
   - **YouTube Data API v3** (for YouTube)
   - **My Business Account Management API**, **My Business Business Information API**, and **Google My Business API** (for Google Business Profile)
3. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials** and create an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** (type: Web application)
4. Add the following redirect URIs under **Authorized redirect URIs**:
   ```
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/youtube/
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/google_business/
   ```
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
6. Required scopes:
   - **YouTube:** `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/yt-analytics.readonly`
   - **Google Business Profile:** `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/business.manage`
7. Set the environment variables:
   ```
   PLATFORM_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   PLATFORM_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   ```

### Pinterest

1. Go to the [Pinterest Developer Portal](https://developers.pinterest.com/) and create a new app
2. Under your app settings, add the redirect URI:
   ```
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/pinterest/
   ```
3. Copy the **App ID** and **App Secret**
4. Required scopes: `user_accounts:read`, `boards:read`, `boards:write`, `pins:read`, `pins:write`
5. Set the environment variables:
   ```
   PLATFORM_PINTEREST_APP_ID=your-app-id
   PLATFORM_PINTEREST_APP_SECRET=your-app-secret
   ```

### Bluesky

No developer app registration needed. Users connect by entering their Bluesky handle and an **App Password**:

1. Log in to [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/)
2. Go to **Settings → Privacy and Security → App Passwords**
3. Create a new app password and use it when connecting your account in Brightbean Studio

### Mastodon

No developer app registration needed. Brightbean Studio automatically registers an OAuth application on each Mastodon instance when a user connects their account. Users just need to enter their instance URL (e.g., `mastodon.social`).

### DEV.to

No developer app registration needed. Users connect by entering a personal **API key**:

1. Log in to [DEV.to](https://dev.to/) and open **[Settings → Extensions](https://dev.to/settings/extensions)**
2. Under **DEV Community API Keys**, enter a description (e.g. `Brightbean`) and click **Generate API Key**
3. Copy the generated key and paste it when connecting your account in Brightbean Studio

Posts publish as DEV.to articles (title + Markdown body). The key can be revoked at any time from the same settings page.

## Inbox: Backfill Historical Messages

See the [Supported Platforms](#supported-platforms) matrix above for per-platform inbox capabilities.

To import historical messages (e.g., from the last 7 days):

```bash
python manage.py backfill_inbox --days 7
```

Options:
- `--days N` - Number of days to backfill (default: 7)
- `--platform NAME` - Only backfill a specific platform (e.g., `facebook`, `youtube`, `linkedin`, `tiktok`)
- `--account-id UUID` - Only backfill a specific account

For Facebook this recovers comments on the Page's posts from the last 30 days — useful after fixing a webhook that was never delivering, since comments missed while it was broken are otherwise invisible:

```bash
python manage.py backfill_inbox --platform facebook --days 30
```

## Inbox: Diagnosing a Facebook Page That Receives Nothing

When a Page's comments never reach the inbox, or a post's first comment never appears, the cause is usually a permission that was not granted or a webhook that was never configured — neither of which is visible from inside the app. Ask Meta directly:

```bash
python manage.py diagnose_facebook --account-id <uuid>
```

It reports the token's granted scopes (a missing `pages_manage_engagement` is why first comments fail), which app is subscribed to the Page and to which fields (`feed` is what carries comments), and whether comments are readable at all. Add `--subscribe` to repair a missing Page subscription in place, or `--json` for output to paste into an incident.

## API & MCP for Agents

BrightBean Studio ships a REST API and an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server so agents and scripts can read analytics, manage media, and create or schedule posts. Both share the same authentication, permission model, rate limits, and audit log. Pick whichever protocol fits your client.

**Base URL:** `{APP_URL}/api/v1/` (e.g. `https://your-studio.example.com/api/v1/`)

### Authentication

Issue an API key from **Organization → API Keys**. Keys are workspace-scoped, can be allowlisted to specific social accounts, and inherit a subset of the issuer's workspace permissions. Revocation takes effect immediately. Send the key as a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer bb_studio_...
```

Also send a `User-Agent` header naming your client (e.g. `User-Agent: my-agent/1.0`). Cloudflare's Browser Integrity Check, which is on by default and fronts the hosted `studio.brightbean.xyz`, rejects Python's standard-library default (`Python-urllib/3.x`) with `403` and a plain-text `error code: 1010` body before the request reaches Studio. Any value of your own gets through; `requests`, `httpx`, curl, and Node clients already send one that does.

Permission keys: `create_posts`, `publish_directly`, `upload_media`, `view_analytics`, `use_inbox`, `reply_from_inbox`. Each endpoint requires the relevant permission; missing permissions return `403`.

### Rate Limits

| Scope | Limit |
|---|---|
| Per-key writes | 120 / min |
| Per-key reads | 300 / min |
| Per-workspace aggregate | 1000 / min |

Rate-limit responses (`429`) include `Retry-After`, `X-RateLimit-Limit`, and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers.

### REST Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose | Permission |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/me` | Inspect caller scope and workspace permissions | — |
| `GET` | `/accounts` | List connected social accounts | — |
| `POST` | `/posts` | Create a draft or scheduled post | `create_posts` (+ `publish_directly` to schedule) |
| `GET` | `/posts/{post_id}` | Read a single post | — |
| `PATCH` | `/posts/{post_id}` | Update draft fields | `create_posts` |
| `POST` | `/posts/{post_id}/schedule` | Schedule a draft | `create_posts` + `publish_directly` |
| `POST` | `/posts/{post_id}/cancel` | Revert a scheduled post to draft | `create_posts` |
| `GET` | `/analytics/accounts/{account_id}` | Channel analytics summary (7/30/90-day window) | `view_analytics` |
| `GET` | `/analytics/posts/{post_id}` | Post analytics with per-platform metrics | `view_analytics` |
| `POST` | `/media` | Upload a media file (multipart) | `upload_media` |
| `GET` | `/media/{media_id}` | Retrieve a media asset | — |
| `GET` | `/media` | List media assets (filter, paginate) | — |
| `GET` | `/inbox` | List inbox messages (filter by status/type/account, paginate) | `use_inbox` |
| `GET` | `/inbox/{message_id}` | Read one inbox message with its reply thread | `use_inbox` |
| `POST` | `/inbox/{message_id}/replies` | Draft a reply (set `send: true` to deliver it now) | `use_inbox` (+ `reply_from_inbox` to send) |
| `PATCH` | `/inbox/replies/{reply_id}` | Edit a draft reply | `use_inbox` |
| `POST` | `/inbox/replies/{reply_id}/send` | Deliver a draft reply to the platform | `reply_from_inbox` |
| `DELETE` | `/inbox/replies/{reply_id}` | Discard a draft reply | `use_inbox` |
| `POST` | `/mcp` | JSON-RPC 2.0 endpoint for MCP clients | — |

Post creation, media uploads, and inbox reply creation accept `idempotency_key` (or `Idempotency-Key` header) for safe retries.

For inbox reply creation, reuse the same key and request to replay the original response without creating or sending another reply. A failed create-and-send response is replayed too; retrieve the retained failed reply from the message thread and retry delivery via `/inbox/replies/{reply_id}/send`.

### MCP Tools

The MCP server lives at `POST {APP_URL}/api/v1/mcp` and speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 over Streamable HTTP. It implements the standard `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, and `ping` methods. Tools:

| Tool | Purpose | Permission |
|---|---|---|
| `list_accounts` | List social accounts this API key can act on | — |
| `create_draft` | Create a draft post (caption, title, media, first comment, optional proposed publish time) | `create_posts` |
| `schedule_post` | Create and schedule a post in one step | `create_posts` + `publish_directly` |
| `schedule_draft` | Schedule an existing draft | `create_posts` + `publish_directly` |
| `get_post` | Retrieve a post with aggregate status and per-platform state | — |
| `list_posts` | List posts newest-first, with optional status filter and cursor pagination | — |
| `cancel_post` | Revert a scheduled post back to draft | `create_posts` |
| `search_media` | Find media assets by query, type, tags, or folder | — |
| `get_media` | Retrieve a single media asset by ID | — |
| `upload_media` | Upload a small base64-encoded file (≤ 1 MB raw). For larger files, use REST `POST /media`. | `upload_media` |
| `get_account_analytics` | Channel analytics over a rolling 7–90 day window | `view_analytics` |
| `get_post_analytics` | Per-platform metrics for a single post (safe for polling drafts) | `view_analytics` |
| `list_inbox_messages` | List inbox items (comments, mentions, DMs, reviews) with their reply threads | `use_inbox` |
| `get_inbox_message` | Retrieve one inbox message and its reply thread | `use_inbox` |
| `create_reply_draft` | Draft a reply to an inbox message (saved, not sent) | `use_inbox` |
| `update_reply_draft` | Replace the body of a draft (or failed) reply | `use_inbox` |
| `discard_reply_draft` | Delete a draft (or failed) reply | `use_inbox` |
| `send_reply` | Deliver a reply (`reply_id`, or `message_id` + `body` to draft-and-send) | `reply_from_inbox` |

### Connecting an MCP client

The server is at `{APP_URL}/api/v1/mcp` and supports two authentication modes — pick whichever your client uses.

**Claude Desktop (and other native OAuth connectors).** In Claude Desktop open **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector**, name it, and enter the server URL `{APP_URL}/api/v1/mcp`. Claude registers itself (Dynamic Client Registration) and opens a browser to log in to BrightBean Studio and approve access — **no API key required**. Any Studio user can connect; the connection acts with **their own** workspace permissions (read-only roles get the read tools, while posting/scheduling/uploading require the matching permission), operating on their last-active workspace. Requires Studio to be served over a public **https** URL.

**Claude Code, Cursor, custom agents (static API key).** Point the client at the same URL and send an API key as a Bearer token (`Authorization: Bearer bb_studio_...`). For Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http brightbean {APP_URL}/api/v1/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer bb_studio_..."
```

### Pre-built agent skill

Don't want to wire up your own client? The companion [brightbean-studio-agent](https://github.com/brightbeanxyz/brightbean-studio-agent) repository hosts a holistic agent skill that drives BrightBean Studio end-to-end through the REST API and MCP tools documented above.

## Troubleshooting

**Docker: `postgres` container is unhealthy**
Wait 10-15 seconds after `docker compose up` for the health check to pass, then retry your command. Check logs with `docker compose logs postgres`.

**`python manage.py migrate` fails with connection errors**
Make sure PostgreSQL is running and healthy. For Docker: `docker compose ps` should show postgres as "healthy". For local: verify the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` matches your setup.

**Tailwind CSS changes not appearing**
Make sure the Tailwind watcher is running: `cd theme/static_src && npm run start`. If styles still don't update, try `npm run build` for a full rebuild.

**OAuth callback errors ("redirect URI mismatch")**
The redirect URI registered on the platform must exactly match `{APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/{platform}/`. Check that `APP_URL` in `.env` matches the URL you're accessing (including `http` vs `https` and port number).

**Threads: "No app ID was provided in the request" (error `4476002`)**
Threads uses its own App ID, not the Facebook one. Set `PLATFORM_THREADS_APP_ID` / `PLATFORM_THREADS_APP_SECRET` from **Use cases → Access the Threads API → Settings**, and register `{APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/threads/` in that same panel — the Facebook Login redirect URI list does not cover Threads. See the [Meta](#meta-facebook-instagram-threads) section.

**Background tasks not running (posts not publishing)**
Make sure the worker is running: `python manage.py process_tasks`. In Docker: check `docker compose logs worker`.

**A post is stuck on "Publishing"**
It shouldn't stay there. `confirm_pending_publishes` runs every 60s and settles anything in that status: asynchronous publishes (TikTok accepts the upload, then transcodes) are confirmed against the platform and marked published or failed with the platform's own reason, and a post whose worker died mid-publish is failed after `PUBLISHER_STALE_PUBLISHING_TIMEOUT` so it becomes editable and retryable again. It is never re-published automatically - we can't tell "the platform never saw it" from "the platform took it and we crashed before recording that", and a duplicate video on a live account can't be undone. A third case is kept distinct on purpose: when the platform accepted the upload but we can't reach it to ask what happened, the sweep keeps reconciling for `PUBLISHER_UNCONFIRMED_TIMEOUT` (6h by default) and, if it never learns the answer, fails the post with copy that tells the user to **check the account before republishing** rather than to try again - the post may already be live. If posts sit on "Publishing" for longer than that, the worker isn't running (see above) or is being killed repeatedly - check its memory.

**Uploaded images 404 in production (and Instagram/Facebook/Pinterest posts fail)**
With `STORAGE_BACKEND=local`, `/media/` must be publicly reachable. Check that `SERVE_MEDIA` is not set to `false` unless your reverse proxy serves `MEDIA_ROOT` at that same path, and that `MEDIA_ROOT` is on a persistent volume. Those platforms fetch attachment URLs server-side, so a 404 there fails the publish, not just the thumbnail.
